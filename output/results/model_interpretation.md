# Ethnic Group Exclusion and Armed Conflict Analysis

## 1. Current Conflict Analysis

### Current Conflict Models Interpretation

1. Effect of exclusion on current conflict: coefficient is 2.0025, statistically significant (p=0.0000), with a positive direction.
   This means that excluded groups are indeed more likely to engage in armed conflict in the same year.

2. Moderating effect of geographic concentration: interaction coefficient is 0.2412, but not significant (p=0.5015).
   We cannot confirm that geographic concentration moderates the exclusion-conflict relationship.

3. Moderating effect of prior governance experience: interaction coefficient is -0.0785, but not significant (p=0.8073).
   We cannot confirm that prior governance experience moderates the exclusion-conflict relationship.

## 2. Future Conflict Analysis

### Future Conflict Models Interpretation

1. Effect of exclusion on future conflict: coefficient is 1.9411, statistically significant (p=0.0000), with a positive direction.
   This means that excluded groups are indeed more likely to engage in armed conflict in the following year.

2. Moderating effect of geographic concentration on future conflict: interaction coefficient is 0.3091, but not significant (p=0.3669).
   We cannot confirm that geographic concentration moderates the exclusion-future conflict relationship.

3. Moderating effect of prior governance experience on future conflict: interaction coefficient is -0.4583, but not significant (p=0.1651).
   We cannot confirm that prior governance experience moderates the exclusion-future conflict relationship.

### Overall Conclusion on Future Conflict

Based on the analysis of future conflict (one year ahead), excluded groups are indeed more likely to engage in armed conflict in the following year.
